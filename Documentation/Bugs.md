# Known Issues

- Thumbnails aren't generated for all items (this is a problem at Internet Archive, not a bug in this software)

    *You will see the broken-image icon.*

- Full text search doesn't seem to allow exact phrase matching

    *A search such as `Pliny The Elder` may return items* <br>
    *mentioning the exact phrase but can also return ones* <br>
    *with `Pliny` on one page and `Elder` on another.*
