# Searches Internet Archive using its full text search for new items matching
# the keywords you specify (in searchlist.txt, one search term per line)
#
# Run this script once a day via crontab for daily updates about new items
# relevant to your research topics
#
# Outputs its findings to an html file, and optionally emails that file
# to you via SendGrid or your system mail (eg Sendmail or Postfix)

# Dependency: Internet Archive command line tool (pip install internetarchive)
# Info at https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive
# Also requires read-write access to the directory the script lives in
